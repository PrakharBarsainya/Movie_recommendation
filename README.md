# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System
An interactive movie recommendation system built with Streamlit, using machine learning techniques to suggest similar movies and the Watchmode API to display movie posters dynamically.

# 📌 Project Overview
This application recommends 10 movies similar to a user-selected movie from the dataset. The UI is powered by Streamlit, and movie posters are fetched in real time using the Watchmode API.

- 📊 Interactive Web UI using Streamlit

- 🔍 complete Movie Search

- 🧠 Easy to deploy and extend

# 🧠 How It Works
- User selects a movie from a dropdown list.
